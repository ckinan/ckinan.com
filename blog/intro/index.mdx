This is the first article of this website. As software engineer, I would be writing stuff related to that field (mmhh or maybe not). For now, I just want to mention the awesome tools I found to build this website.

## Static site generator

- Gatsby
- UPDATE: Moved to Docusaurus on December 2019
- UPDATE: Came back to Gatsby on April 2020
- UPDATE: Moved to my own static site generator on January 2021

## Hosting

- Netlify
- UPDATE: Moved to Digital Ocean on Jan 2021

## Styles

- Plain CSS
- UPDATE: Moved to Tailwind CSS on April 2020
- UPDATE: Plain CSS again on January 2021

Low-level CSS framework that allows me to concentrate in my components and not in css files (in most cases). Tailwind CSS has changed the way I used to see styling stuff and gave me the motivation I needed to explore more about design.

## Final Notes

I am totally new to these technologies, so I might not be using them properly or not aware of all the features they provide. However, for now I am able to rely on few of their products and they're working amazingly.

So, for this first article, I just wanted to point out that building things from scratch is fine, but using platforms and technology built by more expert guys, learn and apply them is even better.

- UPDATE Jan 2021: I decided to use this post to include major changes I'm doing to this site.
