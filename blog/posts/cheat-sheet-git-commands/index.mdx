My Cheat Sheet for: Git Commands (it's supposed to (slowly) grow)

Git log with some styling (colors and specific order I like to see)
```bash
$ git log --pretty=format:"%C(Green)%h %C(Red)[.%D.] %C(Blue)[%an] %C(Yellow)[%s] %C(Magenta)[%ad (%ar)]"
```

Get number of files changed, lines inserted and lines removed between two branches or commits
```bash
$ git diff --shortstat master..develop
 13 files changed, 90 insertions(+), 410 deletions(-)

$ git diff --shortstat 499a153..8059ee2
 3 files changed, 69 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```
