I developed a java application that reads emails, parses the information and stores it into a data source. It's [email-reporter](https://github.com/ckinan/email-reporter).

Currently, it implements:
- Gmail: Queries emails by a given label and dates
- Google Sheets: Reads and writes entries of what is parsed in the emails
- Spring Task Scheduler: Ability to schedule a task to read emails and generate reports by a given cron setup

I wanted to have a sort of plain data of some services I usually consume and get receipts via email. E.g. Uber. I couldn't find an easy way to export my trips' data like the costs, discounts, and all the other fields that I saw interesting to keep track and that I have available in those email messages. Plus, I thought it could be fun to code something like this, and it was.
