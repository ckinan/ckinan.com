> Note #1: I don't want to re-do the documentation in [`git-scm.com`](https://git-scm.com/doc). My goal is to have valuable examples in this document and real experiences of the git commands that need to be handy.
>
> Note #2: After some time I started this document, I noticed this is not giving me any value at all. I am currently thinking of a way to change (maybe) the structure or sections of it, so that I can come here more actively to re-check when I need this cheatsheet.

One of the most used version control system in the world. Most of this doc page is using structure and explanation from [`git-scm.com`](https://git-scm.com/doc).

## Commands

This is a list of commands I frequently use.

### Basic Snapshotting

#### commit

Record changes to the repository

```bash
# Syntax
git commit -m "<msg>"
# Example #1: Save your change
git commit -m "Add new validation"
# Example #2: Bypasses the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
git commit -m 'Add new validation' --no-verify
```

#### diff

Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

```bash
git diff origin/master
```

#### status

Show the working tree status

```bash
git status
```

### Branching and Merging

#### checkout

Switch between branches

```bash
# Syntax
git checkout -b <new_branch>
# Example #1: Switch to an existing branch
git checkout develop
# Example #2: Create new branch and switch
git checkout -b my_feature
```

### Inspection and Comparison

#### log

Show commit logs

```bash
# Your log in (guess what?) one line
git log --oneline
# See commits that is in develop branch but not in master
git log master..develop
# Use --no-merges to avoid noise of merge commits
git log master..develop --oneline --no-merges
# Some format
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ad (%ar) : %s"
# Some format + filtering by author
git log --pretty=format:"%H - %an, %ad (%ar) : %s" --author='Kina'
```

### Patching

#### cherry-pick

Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits

```bash
# Cherrypick a specific commit
git cherry-pick baa4e741b9109ac0bac14659e5a6421b55d13bc7
```

### Still Pending...

```bash
# Basic Snapshotting
git add
git restore
git restore --staged

# Branching and Merging
git branch
git merge master
git merge develop --squash
git branch -d
git branch -D

# Sharing and Updating Projects
git fetch
git pull
git push origin my-feature
```
