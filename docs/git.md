# Intro
This page is about GIT, the most used version control thing in the world. What it is, how to use it, why you should use it.

# Concepts

# Getting started

# Git flows

# Commands

Some commands I use regularly:

```
git checkout -b my-feature
git commit -m "Add something new"
git push origin my-feature
git status
git pull
git merge
```

# Tools

- Last one I used [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)
- Used to use [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

Currently, I am not using any git client, but commands in console ultimately. Reason? Just forcing myself to learn more about git commands.
