This is the first article of this website. As software engineer, I would be writing stuff related to that field (mmhh or maybe not). For now, I just want to mention the awesome tools I found to build this website.

## Gatsby
~~Open source technology to build websites, based on React. Nice features and plugins that can help anyone to develop modern sites. What I really loved about it is that it supports markdown for my posts, plus the starters they provide and share to us, which was so nice since I didn't have to build this site totally from scratch.~~

UPDATE: Moved to Docusaurus December 2019

## Docusaurus
Moved to Docusaurus. I was looking for a static site generator that allows me to build a portfolio/documentation/blog site and found Gatsby with higher learning curve than Docusaurus. Good reason enough for now.

## Netlify
Platform that gives us a full integrated environment to host a web project. I'm publishing my website to this platform which pulls all my codebase (from Github), build the app and deploy it into a production environment using my own domain. All the infraestructure and deployment-related work are handled by this so useful tool.

## Final Notes

I am totally new on these technologies, so I might not be using them properly or not aware of all the features they provide. However, for now I am able to rely on few of their products and they're working amazingly.

So, for this first article, I just wanted to point out that building things from scratch is fine, but using platforms and technology built by more expert guys, learn and apply them is even better.
