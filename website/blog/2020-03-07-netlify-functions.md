## What is "Netlify Functions"?

Serverless functions on AWS Lambda, handled by Netlify. Create, build, deploy and test these serverless functions on Netlify and locally with some great tools that Netlify provides.

Currently, supported languages are:
- JavaScript
- Go

## Concepts

### netlify.toml

### event, context, callback

```js
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    // your server-side functionality
}
```

- `event`
- `context`
- `callback`

## Getting started (example step by step)

yarn add netlify-lambda

## Deploy on Netlify

## Deploy locally
