<p>I developed a java application that reads emails, parses the information and stores it into a data source. It's <a href="https://github.com/ckinan/email-reporter">email-reporter</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, it implements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail: Queries emails by a given label and dates</li>
<li>Google Sheets: Reads and writes entries of what is parsed in the emails</li>
<li>Spring Task Scheduler: Ability to schedule a task to read emails and generate reports by a given cron setup</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to have a sort of plain data of some services I usually consume and get receipts via email. E.g. Uber. I couldn't find an easy way to export my trips' data like the costs, discounts, and all the other fields that I saw interesting to keep track and that I have available in those email messages. Plus, I thought it could be fun to code something like this, and it was.</p>
